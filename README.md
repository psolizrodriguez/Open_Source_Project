## Description
* Following the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), we plan to start by [Setting up a local workspace](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace) under the Eclipse IDE. Once we installed the IDE well Fork JabRef into your GitHub account, Clone our forked repository on your local machine, generate additional source codes and getting dependencies using Gradle for finally building it and getting it running as a Java Application.  
* We plan on using the [guide to pull request]( https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) for requesting the developers a branch pull as specified in the guide.  
* Then we’ll start by reading the [Coding Guide]( https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Code-Howtos) and adding a CHANGELOG.md file as specified in the guide.  
* Once that is done, we will start by fixing issues registered on the [beginners section]( https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/beginner) to get a flavor of the code, for finally working in issues with [more impact]( https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/help-wanted) while following the [FAQ Guide]( http://help.jabref.org/en/FAQcontributing).
