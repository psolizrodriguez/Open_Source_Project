## Description
* Following the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), we plan to start by [Setting up a local workspace](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace) under the Eclipse IDE. Once we installed the IDE well Fork JabRef into your GitHub account, Clone our forked repository on your local machine, generate additional source codes and getting dependencies using Gradle for finally building it and getting it running as a Java Application.  
* We plan on using the [guide to pull request]( https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) for requesting the developers a branch pull as specified in the guide.  
* Then we’ll start by reading the [Coding Guide]( https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Code-Howtos) and adding a CHANGELOG.md file as specified in the guide.  
* Once that is done, we will start by fixing issues registered on the [beginners section]( https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/beginner) to get a flavor of the code, for finally working in issues with [more impact]( https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/help-wanted) while following the [FAQ Guide]( http://help.jabref.org/en/FAQcontributing).

## Summary

We will be working on the JabRef project, which is an open source bibliography reference manager. In short, this application gives the user the ability to add, search, and sort all their references in one place. We plan to contribute to the project by first following the contributing guide on creating a formal pull request and setting up our local workspace using the Eclipse IDE. Once that is done we will need to edit their CHANGELOG.md file in order to accurately document the changes we intend to make. After this is setup and we have created a fork to begin working on the project, we will turn our attention to the beginners section to become familiar with how the code works—this is also the same section that will allow us to contribute to their code more quickly because we will be working on existing bugs in the software. From there, if time permits, we can begin working on issues that have more impact.
